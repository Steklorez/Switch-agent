"""UI-004: safe cleanup of work/job-<id>/ staging directories.

manifest.build_manifest_and_stage() (see manifest.py) only ever copies
real payload bytes into work/job-<id>/ for ARCHIVE-sourced content (a
single "frozen" package file, or a whole "frozen" mod tree) -- a job
whose source is a bare file directly under inbox/ or config.LIBRARY_DIR
(the common case for this project's real usage: plain NSP/NSZ files, never
copied anywhere) leaves nothing there beyond the small manifest.json/
progress.json bookkeeping files. Only the former can ever grow large
enough to be worth cleaning up.

Never `shutil.rmtree(WORK_DIR)` wholesale: a job's staged content is still
needed for as long as that job might legitimately be retried --
db.retry_job() (Stage 4.1's in-place resume) reads progress.json and any
"frozen" files directly, and manifest.verify_manifest_against_source()
re-checks them against the frozen manifest before ever touching the
device. Only jobs in a truly TERMINAL, non-retryable-in-the-conservative
sense state (DONE / DONE_UNVERIFIED) and older than a retention window are
ever eligible -- see CLEANUP_ELIGIBLE_STATUSES. manifest.json/
progress.json themselves are always kept (tiny, and still useful as an
audit trail of what a job actually contained) -- only heavier "frozen"
payload files/directories are ever removed.

No automatic background cleanup task exists or is planned here -- this
module is only ever invoked by an explicit user action (the Web UI's
Settings page "Clean completed staging" button).
